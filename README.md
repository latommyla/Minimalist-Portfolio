<h1 align="center"> Minimalist Portfolio </h1>

## My goal with this first ever Portfolio

This was my first ever portfolio or website that I have ever developed from scratch. I took the oportunity to make it into something that describes myself. I'm such a minimalist and just love very clean websites that aren't crazy flashy, I mean everyone has their own type of style they love. Simple and clean is what I really love, hopfully this portfolio displays that!

## <div id="difficulty"> How difficult was this? </div>

* This project had me thinking about a lot of things and how to make it all work together.
* I wouldn't say it was extremely hard, but on a scale of 1 out of 10. This was definitely a 7ish.
* A lot of trial and error and testing the codes to make sure it doesn't clash with anything.

## <div id="navigation"> Navigation bar and links </div>

* Created a fixed navigation bar with a hover element.
* All images besides the profile picture is a clickable image.
* Hovering over the images, there is a light opacity added.

## <div id="images"> Images </div>

* Photoshop was my best friend for this project.
* Adjusting image sizes then uploading to GitHub.
* Allowed me to have better control of the image.

## <div id="learn"> What did I learn from all this? </div>

* Being patient.
* Using search engines for backup support.
* Testing and uploading to GitHub frequently.
