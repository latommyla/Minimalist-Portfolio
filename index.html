          <p> The very first experience that I had with any type of coding was HTML. HTML was what got me into coding, and never looked back every since. There's still so much to learn about this format, and I will try my best to absorb everything in!

             <p> Cascading Style Sheets is such a beautiful thing. I've always had a thing for design and especially beautiful websites. As you can tell from my portfolio design, I love very minimalistic designs. Something very simple and clean, nothing too flashy.

    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <ul>
     <li> Hello there, my name is Tommy and glad that you can make it here to my first ever portfolio! This is by far the first time I ever started from scratched and tried to applied everything I've learned in class to this page. I am always willing to learn new things and putting myself up for a challenge. Love using my hands to tinker with stuff, put things together, and love seeing the outcome. When things all fall into place and works the way you want it work, I just get that amazing satisfaction and smile on my face! </li><br>
     <li> I've always had an interest in coding but got sidetracked due to me having a huge passion for automotives. Automotives have always been apart of my life due to my Dad being the influencer. But it's never too late to learn something new, and becoming a Software Engineer is my new passion and cannot wait to see what it has in store for me! Also my YouTube channel shows all my work I've done with cars and the link is down below, go check it out! Besides that, come join me and follow my journey of becoming a Software Engineer! </li>
